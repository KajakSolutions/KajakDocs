# Introduction to KajakEngine

KajakEngine is a lightweight yet powerful 2D game engine specifically designed for creating top-down racing games. Built with modern JavaScript/TypeScript, it provides developers with a complete framework for creating engaging racing experiences with realistic physics, AI opponents, and various gameplay mechanics.

## What is KajakEngine?

KajakEngine is a specialized game engine that focuses on the unique requirements of 2D racing games:

- **Physics-based racing**: Realistic car physics including grip, drift, and surface interactions
- **Intelligent AI**: Customizable AI opponents with different behavior patterns
- **Race management**: Complete race infrastructure with checkpoints, timing, and positions
- **Weather effects**: Dynamic weather system affecting gameplay and visuals
- **Item system**: Support for power-ups, obstacles, and interactive elements

## Key Features

### Realistic Vehicle Physics

KajakEngine implements a sophisticated physics model that simulates real-world vehicle dynamics, including:

- Weight transfer during acceleration, braking, and cornering
- Surface-dependent grip and handling
- Realistic collision responses
- Special features like nitro boost and drift mechanics

### Complete Race Infrastructure

The engine includes everything needed to create a full racing experience:
