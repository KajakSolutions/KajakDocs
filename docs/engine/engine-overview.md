# KajakEngine Overview

KajakEngine is a specialized 2D game engine designed specifically for creating top-down racing games. It provides a comprehensive framework for developing racing experiences with realistic physics, AI opponents, and various gameplay mechanics.

## Architecture

KajakEngine is built around these core components:

- **KajakEngine**: The main engine class that manages the game loop, rendering, and scene transitions
- **Scene**: Contains and manages all game objects, physics, and gameplay systems
- **Game Objects**: Various entities that exist within the game world
- **Physics System**: Handles realistic car movement and collisions
- **Race Management**: Tracks checkpoints, lap times, and race positions
- **Input System**: Handles player controls
- **AI System**: Controls computer-operated vehicles

## Main Features

### Game Loop

```typescript
// Start the game loop
engine.start();

// Stop the game loop
engine.stop();
```

The engine implements a time-based game loop that ensures consistent physics across different devices and frame rates.

### Scene Management

```typescript
// Create a scene
const scene = new Scene(worldBounds, mapObject);

// Register and switch scenes
engine.scenes.set(1, scene);
engine.setCurrentScene(1);
```

Scenes act as containers for tracks, menus, and other game states, managing all objects and systems within them.

### Debug Mode

```typescript
// Enable visualization of colliders, AI rays, etc.
engine.setDebugMode(true);
```

Debug mode helps during development by visualizing physics bodies, AI paths, and other normally invisible elements.

## Advanced Features

KajakEngine also includes:

- **Weather System**: Dynamic weather affecting track conditions
- **Power-up System**: Item collection and usage
- **Sound System**: Engine sounds, effects, and music
- **Surface Types**: Different track surfaces with unique handling properties
- **Moving Barriers**: Dynamic track elements

## Integration

KajakEngine can be easily integrated into any web project:

```html
<div id="game-container"></div>
<script>
  const game = new Game();
  game.loadMap("assets/track.json")
    .then(() => game.start());
</script>
```

The engine is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing developers to customize and extend its functionality for their specific racing game needs.
